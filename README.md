# 📊 Portfolio Projects – Data Analysis with SQL, Excel & Tableau

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! As a math student passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, I’ve built a series of projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and interactive dashboard creation. This repository highlights two key projects: **COVID-19 Data Exploration** and **Nashville Housing Data Cleaning**.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Excel (Data cleaning, pivot tables)
- SQL (Joins, CTEs, temp tables, aggregate functions)
- Tableau (Interactive dashboards)
- Data storytelling and insight generation

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration

**Objective:**  
Explore global COVID-19 data using SQL to analyze trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations. Insights are visualized in Tableau for clear communication.

**Tools Used:**  
SQL, Tableau, Excel

**Key Highlights:**
- Compared infection rates and death ratios by country
- Tracked vaccination progress across continents
- Created calculated fields and views for advanced filtering

**Files:**  
- Tableau Dashboard (see below)

### 2. 🏠 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

**Objective:**  
Clean and prepare a messy housing dataset using SQL and Excel for downstream analysis.

**Tools Used:**  
Excel, SQL

**Key Highlights:**
- Standardized inconsistent data entries
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Split and reorganized address data
- Prepared clean dataset for potential price modeling or visualizations

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo or download files
2. Open `.sql` files in your SQL IDE (e.g., SSMS, SQLite)
3. Load Excel files to explore cleaned data
4. View Tableau dashboards via the public link

---

## 📈 Next Steps

- Extend COVID project with Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)
- Add time-series forecasting on vaccination trends
- Build more dashboards from public data (e.g., education, economy)
